Bill Calculator Application, Greg Bevington, 2023, Southern Alberta Institute of Technology

This C# application processes electricity bills for multiple customers. 
Each customer's data, including account number, first name, last name, kWh usage, and bill amount, is stored and calculated based on a fixed set of rules. 
The application creates and manages multiple customer objects, providing insights such as the number of customers processed, total kWh used, and average bill amount.

Developed using Visual Studio, this application provides an interactive environment for users to test its functionality. 
To explore and run the program, simply open the project in a C# equipped Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio and execute it.
